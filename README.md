Julia library for opening a file with the default application determined by the OS.

## Motivation

Many packages implement variations on the same short code snippet. This package maintains a version that can be shared or tested.

This package intends to be very lightweight, and has no dependencies. Nevertheless, if you still don't want to use this as a dependency, you can of course also copy the code of `DefaultApplication.open()` to another package, but then you will have to repeat this to keep up with bugfixes and developments.

## Usage

```julia
import DefaultApplication
DefaultApplication.open("/some/file.png")
```

`open` is not exported from the package, because it would clash with `Base.open`.

## Status

| OS      | version      | status     |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------|
| Linux   | Ubuntu 18.04 | works      |
| Linux   | Debian 8.0   | works      |
| Linux   | Ubuntu 16.04 | works (CI) |
| Windows | 10           | works      |
| OS X    | Darwin 17.7  | works      |

If your OS/version is missing, please test as described below and open an issue with the information so that this table can be extended.

## Testing

Currently there are only partial unit tests, since the functionality of this package is difficult to test without a desktop environment. Testing, bug reports, feature requests and PRs are welcome.

There is a utility function `DefaultApplication.test()` for testing, which prints information for bug reports:

```julia
julia> import DefaultApplication

julia> DefaultApplication.test()
┌ Info: opening text file with the default application
└   path = "/tmp/juliaT2oWTX.txt"
┌ Info: If the file was not opened, please copy the output and open an issue at
